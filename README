                             Lab 1&2 Intro
    1. Quick start
        You need to run the shell script "run" in the directory "./clab/ 
        lab1&2/" to start this software. The sh file "run" can be moved
        to a convenient path as your wish. But to ensure the correct  
        processing of this sh script, the top folder "clab" must be put 
        at your system-userâ€™s root-folder like "/home/$USER/". You may 
        use "./run -h" or "./run" to learn about the usage of the main 
        shell script.
    
    2. Folder Structure
        Different folders in the "./clab/1/lab1&2/" have different and 
        specific usages:
        
        Folder bin: The main executable binary files are stored in the
        folder "/bin". And the source C++ files are stored in the 
        "/bin/src/", you may specialize the parameters of this software 
        by rewrite the head of the source file "/bin/src/*.cpp" as 
        your wish.
        
        Folder cfg: The CFG files generated by the getcfg program are 
        stored in the folder "./tg" while the given std-cfg files are 
        stored in the folder "./sc".
        
        Folder csc: The CSC tools, which includes the C source files 
        and the executable binary file, are stored here.
        
        Folder elf: The executable files compiled from the original C 
        examples and the C files generated by this software, are stored 
        respectively in the folder "./sc/" and "./tg/".
        
        Folder elf_op: The executable files compiled from the original C 
        examples and the C files generated by this software with optimizaion, 
        are stored respectively in the folder "./sc/" and "./tg/".
        
        Folder examples: All the given tested C files are stored here. 
        You may add your own test examples here if you wish. Every single 
        C files stored here will be automatically tested when you use 
        the command line "./run -t [-s]".
        
        Folder finalc: All the C files generated by this software from 
        the examples in the "../examples/" will be stored here.
        
        Folder finalc_op: All the C files generated by this software from 
        the examples in the "../examples/" with optimization will be stored
        here.
        
        Folder mid: The files generated during the processing of this 
        software. The midc files, which are used for software, are not 
        readable for us. While the mid1 files, which are the comment 
        files translated from the tri-code, are used to help us understand 
        the tri-code.
        
        Folder mid_op: The files generated during the processing of this 
        software. The midc files types can be distinguished by the different
        postfixes. For example, a file who has the name as "*_cp_dce.midc"
        is generated by the test with the option [-op3].
        
        Folder reports: the reports of two tests are respectively stored
        in the files named as "reports1.txt" and "reports2.txt". 
        
        Folder sample: The files generated when processing a single test
        are all stored here.
        
        Folder tri: Tri-code files generated by the CSC. The tri1 files 
        are similar to those original tri-code files, which are only 
        different in the first and the last line.
        
    3. Notation
        The shell script named as "getcmd" are used to fetch a specific 
        tri-code command in the tri-code files stored in the folder 
        "/tri/".You may use getcmd like "./getcmd [command]" to fetch
        a specific "[command]".
        
    4. Check the test result
        This software also provide an easy way to check if you have 
        passed the test. To check the result, you may take a look at
        the file named as "report1.txt" or "report2.txt" stored in the 
        porject directory "/clab/lab1&2/reports". Only if you have done 
        a test, the report can be saved and checked.
